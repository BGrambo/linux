You are working as a Linux system administrator for the server DevOpsLogsServer, and your colleague has tasked you with exploring some essential commands to ensure you are familiar with their usage and options.

    You need to check the manual for the ls command to review its options and usage.
    Next, try checking the command documentation for cp using pinfo.
    You are also asked to explore the usage of the mkdir command but only use the --help option to get a summary of its available flags.
